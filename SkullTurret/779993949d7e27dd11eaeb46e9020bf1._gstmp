# The following are settings for the skull and skull bow recipes
# A recipe is set in a grid and looks something like below:
#    
#  TL  TM  TR
#  CL  --  CR
#  BL  BM  BR
#
# The center of the grid is unavailable because its used for the Skull or bow item and is hardcoded
# TL for the TopLeft recipe slot
# TM for the TopMiddle recipe slot
# TR for the TopRight recipe slow
# CL for the CenterLeft recipe slot
# CR for the CenterRight recipe slot
# BL for the BottomLeft bottom recipe slot
# BM for the BottomMiddle recipe slot
# BR for the BottomRight recipe slot
#
# A Recipes' materials or Dye must be valid with the current version of bukkit you are using
# They must be entered exactly as they are in the material or dye list mentioned below
# This includes capitalization and underscores if necessary
# AIR values are ignored and considered to be an empty grid location
# Material list may be found at http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Lastly because the Wizard Skull uses a Dye in its recipe I also must support dyes based on color
# The Dye color list can be found at http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/DyeColor.html
#
# Crafted amount is the amount of items that a single recipe will craft into
# This allows you to use the crafting ingredients and get multiple skulls per craft
#
# If Enabled is true then the recipe is loaded for use by players.
# If false the recipe is not loaded and that skull type can not be crafted. The give command is unaffected
# by this setting.
