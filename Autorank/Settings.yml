# This is the interval between checks of Autorank (in minutes).
# Lowering this number will increase accuracy but will also increase server lag.

# You can specify what time plugin Autorank will use to calculate the time that a player has played.
# This only changes the local time. 
# A list to choose from:
# 1. Autorank
# 2. Stats
# 3. OnTime
# If no valid time plugin was found, it defaults to Autorank

advanced dependency output: false
# If this is true, Autorank will tell you in the console what dependencies were found and which ones weren't found.
# Turn this off to remove the console spam from Autorank about dependencies.
# This feature can be useful when Autorank can't find your dependency, but you have it installed.

# When this is true, Autorank will spit out debug messages

allow infinite ranking: true
# When this is false, players will only be able to rank up a certain rank once. 
# When a player ranks up, and gets deranked manually by a staff member, he will be stuck on that rank forever, as he has already completed that rank before.
# Set this to true when you're having problems with players not ranking up.

show warnings: true
# Whether Autorank has to show critical warnings.
# Leave this set to true. You can only change it to false when Autorank is giving you false warnings.
